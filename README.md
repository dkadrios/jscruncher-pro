# JSCruncher Pro

This is the open sourced version of JSCruncher Pro 3.5, written in Delphi 3 and kept current through to Delphi 7.

JSCruncher Pro was the first commercial JavaScript obfuscator and compressor.  It saw heavy usage and growth from 2001 until roughly 2008, when sales dropped off due to the emergence of open sourced compressors.
